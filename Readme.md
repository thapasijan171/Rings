# WebGi Jewelry Landing Page

A template for buildind scrollable landing pages with Gsap, ScrollTrigger and webgi engine in typescript using parcel bundler.

All the code responsible for rendering is only 20 lines long. The rest of the code handles the interface, with the Scroll-based animations using the GSAP ScrollTrigger, which is quite powerful for building experiences like this.
